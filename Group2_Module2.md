## Overview of the Business Problem

Business Problem Overview

Samsung’s Galaxy smartphone division, which contributes over $100 billion annually in revenue, is struggling with persistent demand forecasting challenges in a volatile global market. External pressures such as U.S. tariffs, economic instability, and weak consumer demand in China have intensified these issues. In the fourth quarter of 2025, Samsung’s global market share declined from 21% to 19%, with 61.4 million units shipped but an estimated $5–7 billion lost due to excess inventory and missed sales opportunities (IDC, 2025).

The root cause lies in the fragmentation of data across supply chain operations, consumer trends, and global events, which prevents timely and accurate forecasting. As a result, Samsung’s inventory management is often reactive rather than predictive especially for premium products like the Galaxy S25 leading to overproduction, stock shortages, and profit erosion. Tariff-related shipment delays and cost increases have further limited the company’s ability to respond quickly to demand surges, particularly in key markets like the U.S.

To remain competitive against analytics-driven rivals such as Apple, Samsung must integrate its disparate data systems and apply advanced predictive analytics. This approach would enable more accurate demand forecasting, reduce waste, optimize inventory, and strengthen decision-making, supporting the company’s Vision 2030 goal of sustainable and data-driven growth.

## Business Objectives for an Analytics-Based Solution
1. Strengthen demand forecasting by 25%
Use advanced machine-learning models to improve how Samsung predicts demand for Galaxy devices. More accurate forecasts will help reduce current error rates and give the company enough lead time to adjust production before market shifts hit.

2. Cut inventory carrying costs by 20%
Introduce real-time inventory simulations and smarter replenishment models to reduce the amount of capital tied up in excess parts. This can unlock close to $1 billion currently sitting in overstock—especially during periods of tariff-driven supply chain delays.

3. Grow premium-segment market share by 5%
Leverage trend analytics to tailor promotions and product pushes by region. The goal is to sell an additional 2 million Galaxy S-series units in fast-growing markets such as India by matching supply and marketing activity with emerging demand patterns.

## Leadership Requirements for a Successful Analytics Solution

Improving forecasting accuracy requires leadership that can translate analytics strategy into operational impact. First, executive alignment and sponsorship are critical. Leaders must formally prioritize forecasting accuracy, create cross-functional analytics governance structures, and align global operations under a unified data strategy. Strategic leadership principles—anticipating, aligning, and learning—ensure analytics initiatives receive consistent direction and support.

Second, leaders must promote agile collaboration and a data-driven culture. Following Bean’s (2020) agile analytics philosophy, Samsung’s leaders should support rapid experimentation, short feedback loops, and open communication between domain experts, data engineers, and data scientists. This aligns closely with the enhanced CRISP-DM model, which emphasizes human-skill complementarity and continuous iteration (Bokrantz et al., 2024).

Third, leaders must ensure ethical and transparent data governance. Samsung operates across multiple regulatory environments, requiring strict compliance with privacy laws such as GDPR and PIPA. Leadership should implement AI ethics checkpoints, establish data-access protocols, and monitor models for drift and bias (Thiemann, 2020). These practices strengthen organizational trust and improve model reliability during ongoing operation and maintenance.

Finally, leaders should develop analytics literacy across teams, equipping planners and managers to interpret dashboards, understand model limitations, and make informed decisions. This competency-building supports cultural adoption and reduces reliance on technical teams alone.

## Summary Connecting Business Problem to Data Mining Solution
Samsung Galaxy's demand forecasting problems, worsend by tariffs and market changes, require data mining to find useful patterns in sources like sales records, economic data, and social media. Using CRISP-DM's modeling and evaluation steps, methods like time-series ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) or neural networks can reveal links, such as how tariffs influence U.S. demand, and assist in building models to plan inventory. Following Davenport and Harris's (2007) analytics framework, this approach can cut $5 billion in losses and help Samsung stay ahead of disruptions, supporting a stronger, data-driven business.
