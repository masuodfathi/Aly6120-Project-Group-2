# Business Understanding: Enhancing Demand Forecasting for Samsung Galaxy Smartphones

## Overview of the Business Problem

Samsung's Galaxy series, its main smartphone line that brings in over $100 billion annually, faces ongoing demand forecasting problems in a competive market. Global issues like U.S. tariffs, economic uncertainty, and weak demand in China make these problems worse. In the fourth quarter of 2025, Samsung held a 19% share of the global smartphone market, down from 21% in 2024. The company shipped 61.4 million units but lost an estimated $5-7 billion due to excess inventory and missed sales, according to IDC (IDC, 2025).

These problems come from data being separated across supply chains, consumer trends, and global events. This leads to inventory management that reacts too slowly, hurting profits in high-end models like the Galaxy S25. For example, higher tariffs delayed parts shipments, raised costs by 15%, and caused Samsung to miss a surge in U.S. demand. Meanwhile, competitors like Apple use predictive analytics to produce just-in-time. To fix this, following the CRISP-DM business understanding phase, Samsung should bring together different data sources to improve demand forecasts, cut waste, and respond faster. As Davenport and Harris (2007) note in Competing on Analytics, strong analytics can turn forecasting into a way to drive revenue, which is key for Samsung's Vision 2030 goals in uncertain markets.

## Business Objectives for an Analytics-Based Solution
- Increase forecast accuracy by 25%: Use machine learning to better predict demand for Galaxy models, lowering errors from 20% to 15% and allowing for more proactive production changes.
- Reduce inventory holding costs by 20%: Improve inventory management with real-time simulations, which can free up $1 billion in capital currently tied up in extra parts during tariff changes.
- Grow market share by 5% in the premium segment: Use trend analysis to tailor regional promotions and aim to sell 2 million more Galaxy S phones in growing markets such as India.

## Leadership Requirements for a Successful Analytics Solution

Improving forecasting accuracy requires leadership that can translate analytics strategy into operational impact. First, executive alignment and sponsorship are critical. Leaders must formally prioritize forecasting accuracy, create cross-functional analytics governance structures, and align global operations under a unified data strategy. Strategic leadership principles—anticipating, aligning, and learning—ensure analytics initiatives receive consistent direction and support.

Second, leaders must promote agile collaboration and a data-driven culture. Following Bean’s (2020) agile analytics philosophy, Samsung’s leaders should support rapid experimentation, short feedback loops, and open communication between domain experts, data engineers, and data scientists. This aligns closely with the enhanced CRISP-DM model, which emphasizes human-skill complementarity and continuous iteration (Bokrantz et al., 2024).

Third, leaders must ensure ethical and transparent data governance. Samsung operates across multiple regulatory environments, requiring strict compliance with privacy laws such as GDPR and PIPA. Leadership should implement AI ethics checkpoints, establish data-access protocols, and monitor models for drift and bias (Thiemann, 2020). These practices strengthen organizational trust and improve model reliability during ongoing operation and maintenance.

Finally, leaders should develop analytics literacy across teams, equipping planners and managers to interpret dashboards, understand model limitations, and make informed decisions. This competency-building supports cultural adoption and reduces reliance on technical teams alone.

## Summary Connecting Business Problem to Data Mining Solution
Samsung Galaxy's demand forecasting problems, worsend by tariffs and market changes, require data mining to find useful patterns in sources like sales records, economic data, and social media. Using CRISP-DM's modeling and evaluation steps, methods like time-series ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) or neural networks can reveal links, such as how tariffs influence U.S. demand, and assist in building models to plan inventory. Following Davenport and Harris's (2007) analytics framework, this approach can cut $5 billion in losses and help Samsung stay ahead of disruptions, supporting a stronger, data-driven business.
