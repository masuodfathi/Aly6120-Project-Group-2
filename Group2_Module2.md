# Business Understanding: Enhancing Demand Forecasting for Samsung Galaxy Smartphones

## Overview of the Business Problem

Samsung's Galaxy series, its main smartphone line that brings in over $100 billion annually, faces ongoing demand forecasting problems in a competive market. Global issues like U.S. tariffs, economic uncertainty, and weak demand in China make these problems worse. In the fourth quarter of 2025, Samsung held a 19% share of the global smartphone market, down from 21% in 2024. The company shipped 61.4 million units but lost an estimated $5-7 billion due to excess inventory and missed sales, according to IDC (IDC, 2025).

These problems come from data being separated across supply chains, consumer trends, and global events. This leads to inventory management that reacts too slowly, hurting profits in high-end models like the Galaxy S25. For example, higher tariffs delayed parts shipments, raised costs by 15%, and caused Samsung to miss a surge in U.S. demand. Meanwhile, competitors like Apple use predictive analytics to produce just-in-time. To fix this, following the CRISP-DM business understanding phase, Samsung should bring together different data sources to improve demand forecasts, cut waste, and respond faster. As Davenport and Harris (2007) note in Competing on Analytics, strong analytics can turn forecasting into a way to drive revenue, which is key for Samsung's Vision 2030 goals in uncertain markets.

## Business Objectives for an Analytics-Based Solution
- Increase forecast accuracy by 25%: Use machine learning to better predict demand for Galaxy models, lowering errors from 20% to 15% and allowing for more proactive production changes.
- Reduce inventory holding costs by 20%: Improve inventory management with real-time simulations, which can free up $1 billion in capital currently tied up in extra parts during tariff changes.
- Grow market share by 5% in the premium segment: Use trend analysis to tailor regional promotions and aim to sell 2 million more Galaxy S phones in growing markets such as India.

## Leadership Requirements for a Successful Analytics Solution
- Executive alignment and sponsorship: Leaders should support incorporating analytics into the supply chain strategy to get buy-in from different teams and ensure resources are prioritized.
- Promote agile collaboration: Encourage teams to work in short cycles and foster a safe environment for sharing ideas, as Bean (2020) suggests in Fail Fast, Learn Faster. This helps teams innovate even when forecasts are uncertain.
- Enforce ethical data governance: Establish privacy-compliant systems for handling global data, following Thiemann's (2020) Minding the Machines, to reduce risks such as regulatory fines.

## Summary Connecting Business Problem to Data Mining Solution
Samsung Galaxy's demand forecasting problems, worsend by tariffs and market changes, require data mining to find useful patterns in sources like sales records, economic data, and social media. Using CRISP-DM's modeling and evaluation steps, methods like time-series ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) or neural networks can reveal links, such as how tariffs influence U.S. demand, and assist in building models to plan inventory. Following Davenport and Harris's (2007) analytics framework, this approach can cut $5 billion in losses and help Samsung stay ahead of disruptions, supporting a stronger, data-driven business.
