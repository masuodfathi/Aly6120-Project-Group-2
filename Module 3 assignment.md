# Data Understanding for Enhancing Demand Forecasting of Samsung Galaxy Smartphones

## Introduction

Samsung’s Galaxy smartphone division has faced recurring challenges in predicting global demand accurately, resulting in overproduction, missed sales, and inventory losses. To address this issue, the data-understanding phase of the CRISP-DM framework focuses on identifying and assessing the data required to build reliable forecasting models. This section defines the datasets, sources, and quality considerations essential for improving forecasting accuracy and operational agility.

## 1. Data Requirements and Rationale
To improve Samsung's demand forecasting with analytics and the CRISP-DM framework, it is important to use high-quality data sources. These sources should cover consumer behavior, supply chain activity, and market trends. The main requirements are:

Historical Sales Data: Collect weekly or monthly Galaxy sales numbers, regional details, product life cycles, and carrier or retailer data. This helps find trends like seasonality and demand patterns using models such as ARIMA or LSTM.
Supply Chain Data: Track component lead times, production capacity, inventory changes, shipments, and supplier costs or tariffs. This information helps model supply limits and prevent stock shortages or excess, which can save $5-7 billion in losses.
Market and Competitor Data: Use market share data (such as IDC), competitor product cycles like those of Apple or Xiaomi, carrier trends, and economic indicators like GDP or inflation. This helps adjust forecasts for sudden market changes.
Consumer Trends: Analyze search volumes, social media sentiment, pre-orders, reviews, and website clickstreams. Machine learning on this unstructured data can spot early changes in demand.
Marketing Data: Ad spends, promotions, discounts, and partnerships to isolate true demand and measure ROI, targeting 25% accuracy gains.
External Factors: Monitor tariffs, geopolitical events, regulations, and disruptions. This allows for proactive changes to inventory plans.
Governance and Quality: Use standard data formats, real-time ETL or ELT pipelines, and follow GDPR rules. This ensures data integrity and lowers the risk of fragmented information.
By bringing these elements together, Samsung can use AI to improve forecasting, lower inventory costs, and support growth in the high-end market.
