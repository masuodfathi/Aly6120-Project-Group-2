# Introduction
This project outlines a comprehensive analytics program designed to strengthen Samsung’s demand-forecasting capability for its Galaxy smartphone portfolio. Using the CRISP-DM framework as the guiding structure, the work brings together business understanding, data integration, modeling, evaluation, and deployment into a single, cohesive plan.
The goal is not only to improve forecasting accuracy but to embed analytics into Samsung’s operational and strategic decision-making processes. Because the company operates across diverse markets with fast-changing demand patterns, the forecasting system must be both technically sound and organizationally adoptable.
As the analytics program lead, my responsibility is to align teams, clarify objectives, manage uncertainty, and ensure that the solution adds real business value. This report reflects how analytics, governance, and leadership work together to create a forecasting capability that is reliable, explainable, and ready for scale.
## 1. Understanding the Business Problem
### 1.1 Background and Context
Samsung operates a large, globally distributed supply chain supporting its Galaxy smartphone portfolio. Demand patterns vary sharply across regions due to product launches, promotions, competitor activity, and macroeconomic shifts. Current demand planning still leans heavily on manual spreadsheets and fragmented data sources, leading to stockouts in high-demand regions and excess inventory in others. These inefficiencies raise operational costs and reduce responsiveness.
To address this, Samsung is developing a modern forecasting and scenario-planning capability. As the analytics program lead, my role is to align business teams, technical groups, and regional stakeholders to build a solution that improves accuracy and becomes embedded in operational decision-making.
## 1.2 Business Problem Statement
Samsung struggles to consistently match smartphone supply with true market demand. Existing forecasts are often reactive, based on partial information, and vary across regions. This gap highlights the absence of a unified, data-driven forecasting capability that can provide early-warning signals, guide production decisions, and consistently align supply with real-time market demand, a void this initiative aims to fill. This results in:
-	Excess inventory and increased carrying costs.
-	Stockouts during major launches or promotions.
-	Limited visibility into competitor-driven or economic demand shocks.

The goal is to build an integrated forecasting system that brings together ERP data, sell-out feeds, promotions, and external indicators to improve accuracy and support better planning decisions.
## 1.3 Business Objectives & Success Criteria

### Objective 1 — Improve forecast accuracy by ~25%
Baseline MAPE for key Galaxy lines is around 30–35%. A reduction of ~25% is realistic and meaningful.

### Objective 2 — Reduce inventory-carrying costs by 20%
Improved accuracy lowers overproduction and misallocated stock.

### Objective 3 — Grow premium market share by 5% in select regions
Better forecasting supports targeted allocation and promotion strategies.

Overall Success Criteria
- Improved forecasting accuracy
- Reduced operational inefficiencies
- Stronger competitive positioning

## 1.4 Data Mining Goals
-	Develop a robust hybrid forecasting engine
-	Enable scenario planning for demand shocks
-	Improve data governance and reliability


## 1.5 Constraints & Assumptions
-	Varying analytics maturity across regions
-	Fragmented data systems
-	Continued executive sponsorship and regional engagement

## 1.6 Leadership Approach
My leadership style emphasizes strategic clarity, cross-functional collaboration, and clear communication. Structured alignment meetings, visual storytelling, and open discussions around data issues ensure that teams remain aligned and the system gains trust.
