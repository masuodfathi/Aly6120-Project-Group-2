# Why SARIMA
SARIMA is one of the most reliable and widely used time-series forecasting models because it captures three essential components of Samsung’s sales behavior:

1. Strong seasonality in smartphone demand

Samsung experiences predictable spikes around:

- New product launches (S-series, Z-series)

- Black Friday

- Holiday seasons

- Back-to-school periods

** SARIMA is designed specifically to detect repeating seasonal cycles and model them accurately (Hyndman & Athanasopoulos, 2021).**

2. Stable long-term patterns

Demand for high-end electronics typically follows:

- Multi-year life-cycles

- Slow-moving trends

- Recurring peaks and troughs

** SARIMA handles this type of stable structure extremely well.**
