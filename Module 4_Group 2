Data Preparation Project

#1. Data Sources
The main data source is the “Samsung Mobile Sales Dataset” (Kaggle, 2024), 
which is a quarterly dataset with over 1,000 rows from 2019 to 2024. 
It includes key variables like Units Sold, Revenue, Market Share, 5G Capability, Regional 5G Coverage, 
Subscribers, Speed, Preference, and Region. For validation and benchmarking.


#2. Internal vs. External
Right now, all data comes from extrnal sources, specifically the public Kaggle release. 
In an actual Samsung project, about 60–70% of the data would be internal, such as SAP ERP sales records, 
Samsung Members telemetry, supply chain planning, and procurement logs. The remaining 30–40% would be external 
tracking competitor activity, macroeconomic factors such as tariffs and GDP, and independent 5G rollout data that 
Samsung does not have internally.
